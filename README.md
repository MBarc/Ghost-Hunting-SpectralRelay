<h1 align="center">SpectralRelay: A Ghost Hunting Device</h1>

SpectralRelay is a software-defined radio (SDR)-based tool designed for scanning and analyzing radio frequencies. Originally envisioned for paranormal investigations, this project is a versatile solution capable of sweeping through different frequency ranges, processing live radio signals, and converting them into audible formats. Users will be able to listen to real-time audio feed and analyze logged data for further analysis.

## How It Works

Thereâ€™s a hypothesis suggesting that the manifestation of a spirit causes a localized drop in temperature. To test this, the design leverages a TTP223B touch sensor in conjunction with three DHT22 temperature sensors. When a spirit interacts with the TTP223B, the two DHT22 sensors positioned nearby should register a temperature drop. A third DHT22 sensor, placed on the opposite side of the device, monitors the room's ambient temperature. By comparing these readings, we can determine if the drop in temperature near the TTP223B is anomalous. If the TTP223B registers contact and the temperature near the front two DHT22 sensors is significantly lower than the ambient room temperature, it suggests possible interaction by a spirit.

## Features

### Dual Confirmation Mechanism
The device confirms the presence of a spirit through two simultaneous criteria:
1. **Touch Detection**:
   - The TTP223B Capacitive Touch Sensor detects physical contact.
2. **Temperature Anomaly**:
   - The two front DHT22 sensors register a temperature colder than the environmental temperature recorded by the back DHT22 sensor.

This dual confirmation system helps minimize false positives and ensures reliable detection.
